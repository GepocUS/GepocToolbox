# GepocToolbox

This Matlab toolbox contains an assortment of classes and functions for various uses in the fields of predictive control and optimization. Some of the main features are:

* A class for defining and solving QP problems.

* A class that extends the **ss** class from Matlab that makes it easier to work with state space models obtained from the linearizing plants subject to constraints.

* Classes for different MPC formulations that make defining the MPC optimization problem and solving them easy.

* Various solvers for different classes of optimization problems.

* Various functions useful in the fields of optimization and control.
