# GepocToolbox

Welcome to GepocToolbox, a Matlab toolbox that contains an assortment of classes and function useful for those working in the fields of optimization and predictive control.

GepocToolbox is developed and maintained by the [GEPOC](https://grupo.us.es/gepoc/) research team at the University of Seville.

## Installation

Clone or download the contents of the repository to a directory of your choice, which we will call `$root$` in this explanation. Then move Matlab's current folder to `$root$` and execute `gepoc('install')` in the command window.


Alternatively, you can manually add the following folders to Matlab's path.

> * $root$
> * $root$/classes
> * $root$/functions
> * $root$/solvers

To uninstall simply execute `gepoc('uninstall')` in the command window. You can also manually remove the above folders from Matlab's path.

## Usage and documentation

There is no thorough documentation for the toolbox, since it is a collection of lots of loosely related functions and classes.
You can find specific documentation for each function and class using Matlab's `help`.
